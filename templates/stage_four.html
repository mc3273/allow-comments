          <h3>4.1: Introduction to Networks</h3>
            <p class="one">
                <p><b> What is a Network</b> A network is a group of entities that can communicate, even though they are not directly connected. Webopedia explains a Network this way : A network is a group of two or more computer systems linked together. There are many types of computer networks, including the following: </p>
            <br>
                <p>local-area networks (LANs): The computers are geographically close together (that is, in the same building).</p>
                <p>wide-area networks (WANs): The computers are farther apart and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves.</p>
                <p>campus-area networks (CANs): The computers are within a limited geographic area, such as a campus or military base.</p>
                <p>metropolitan-area networks MANs): A data network designed for a town or city.</p>
                <p>home-area networks (HANs): A network contained within a user's home that connects a person's digital devices.</p>

                <p><b> How to make a network work</b> 1)We need a way to encode and interpret messages 2)We need a way to route messages 3)We need rules </p>

                <p><b> Measuring Networks</b> </p>

                <p><b> Latency</b> Time it takes for a message to get from the source to the destination, from the start of the message, unit of time measured in milliseconds today </p>

                <p><b> Bandwith</b> Amount of information that can be transmitted per unit time, once you have some part of the message across what is the rate it can be received. Can be measured in MBPS(Megs bit's per second) </p>

                <p><b> Bit</b> 1 bit = smallest unit of information, in computing we think of it as 0 and 1, If you have more bits you can encode more things</p>

                <p><b> Protocal</b> set of rules that people agree to that set a policy on how to get through the internetOn the web we use HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</p>
